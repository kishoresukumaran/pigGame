      <h1>Pig Game 🐷</h1>
      <p>
        Pig is a simple dice game <br />
        <br>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a
        die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": <br />
        <ul>
          <li>If
            the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn. </li>
          <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to
            their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
          <li>If a player chooses to
            "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the
            next player's turn.</li>
        </ul>  The first player to score 100 or more points wins. <br><br>
        For example, the first player, Karthic, begins a turn with a roll of 5.
        Karthic could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Karthic
        rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to
        roll again. Karthic rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The
        next player, Bharani, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she
        chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
